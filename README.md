## 📌 Overview

This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and comparative study to address the research question:  
**“Is Subway really a healthier choice than McDonald’s?”**

Leveraging official nutrition data from Subway and a curated McDonald’s dataset, the analysis compares key nutritional metrics (calories, fat, sugar, sodium, protein, and fiber) to evaluate whether Subway’s "healthy" branding is supported by evidence or driven by marketing.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ In-depth EDA of nutritional profiles for both brands.
- ✅ Comparative analysis of calorie, fat, sodium, sugar, protein, and fiber distributions.
- ✅ Category-specific breakdowns (e.g., salads, desserts, sandwiches, sauces).
- ✅ Healthiness classification and nutrient risk flagging.
- ✅ Insights into marketing perception versus nutritional reality.
